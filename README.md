# TotallyNormalCalculator

At first glance, this app appears to be a totally normal calculator - just as the title says. 
But after pressing the "." button 4 times, you'll be able to unlock the secret diary function that's hidden beneath.
Once unlocked, you can add new entries, read, modify, and delete them as you like. 

To be added soon:

- application logo ✓
- making the diary draggable ✓
- styling text boxes ✓
- diary entries get saved (SQL implementation)
- layout improvements ✓
- unit tests
