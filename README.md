# TotallyNormalCalculator

At first glance, this app appears to be a totally normal calculator - just as the title says. 
But after entering the correct password, you'll be able to unlock the secret diary function that's hidden beneath.
Once unlocked, you can add new entries, read, modify, and delete them as you like. 

To be added soon:

- light/dark mode
- application logo  
- making the diary draggable
- styling text boxes & scrollbars
- diary entries get saved
- bugfixes & layout improvements
- unit tests
